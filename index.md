## Student Management Database

Â This app will simulate what a student management system will work like, allowing capabilities for:
 
 -Create/edit a class
 
 -Create/edit a student
 
 -Register a student for a class
 
 -Drop a student from a class
 
 -View a student's classes
 
 -View enrolled students for a class

For my final app I developed a Student Management Database app.

This app is aimed towards teachers and administrators to help organize and store students and their classes. It simulates what a student management system will work like and allows for capabilities such as creating students and classes, registering and dropping students, and storing the information.

The app displays a menu with several options ranging from creating and deleting students and classes to enrollment and lists of students and classes. Based on the menu option selected, the app prompts the user for the necessary input and stores the information in the appropriate areas.
